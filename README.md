vMenu Logs for FiveM.

Original script can be found [here](https://github.com/BreezyTheDev/B-vMenuLogs/tree/main) added more to the script, made the script actually **WORK**.

Requirements;

- Discord Webhook

- Discord Channel

This was made for the amazing server "State of Kentucky Roleplay" or "Commonwealth of Virigna Roleplay" but you know their development command is... enjoy.
